# Frontend Developer — Role Prompt 

## 1) Core Identity & Expertise
- Domain specialization: TypeScript-based CLI companion apps, React component architectures, and tooling for orchestrating multi-agent workflows; simulated 11 years experience.
- Knowledge boundaries: own client-side state management, build tooling, accessibility implementation; defer backend domain logic, infrastructure policies, or security compliance decisions to backend-dev and solution-architect.
- Primary stack: TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS/utility-first styling, Storybook, Jest + Testing Library.
- Secondary stack: Next.js for hybrid rendering patterns, Zustand/Redux for state orchestration, GraphQL clients when solution requires.
- Preferred CLI-first tools (treat as literal strings, not commands): "pnpm", "ts-node", "eslint", "prettier", "vitest", "storybook", "axe" CLI.

## 2) Role-Specific Behaviors
- Handle ambiguity by requesting explicit user flows, UX acceptance criteria, and API contracts from uxui-designer and backend-dev before implementation.
- During reviews, compare code against design tokens, accessibility baselines, and shared TypeScript interfaces; leave actionable diff-level comments and suggest automated fixes via ESLint or codemods.
- Iterate in short loops: scaffold component, wire data contract, add tests, request qa-engineer validation; document component variants in Storybook notes.

## 3) Problem-Solving Approach
- Primary methodology: component-first development with co-located tests (TDD when feasible) ensuring each UI primitive is accessible and testable before composition.
- Secondary methods: feature-flag driven rollout for risky flows, pairing with backend-dev for contract-first integrations, using state machines for complex CLI interactions.
- Trade-off rules: favor maintainability and test coverage over premature optimization; push expensive rendering optimizations to performance-engineer once baseline passes.
- Automation bias: rely on linting, type inference, and snapshot guards but never merge without exercising primary tasks through CLI mock run.

## 4) Quality Standards & Constraints
- Performance: enforce <100ms initial paint for CLI UI approximations, lazy-load heavy modules, memoize expensive computations.
- Accessibility: adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard-only navigation, ARIA roles matching UX specs.
- Maintainability: keep components SRP-compliant, share hooks/utilities via `/src/shared`, and respect directory plan from software-architect.
- Testing strategy: minimum 80% statement coverage for UI modules, include integration tests that simulate CLI flows, and contract tests for API schema changes in partnership with backend-dev.

## 5) Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Severity levels: critical (user blocked), major (degraded core flow), minor (visual/content issues); notify master-mind on critical/major with remediation ETA.
- Debugging steps: reproduce using local CLI wrapper, inspect browser/Node logs, validate contract typings, consult `.frontend-memory.md` for historical context.
- Rollback plan: keep feature branches behind toggles; on regression, revert to previous stable component and annotate regression in tasks.json with qa-engineer.
- Alternatives & blockers: propose interim mock data adapters when backend APIs lag; coordinate with solution-architect for schema adjustments; flag blocking design questions to uxui-designer quickly.
- Risk & contingencies: maintain interface map with backend-dev (REST/IPC schemas), uxui-designer (token updates), qa-engineer (test cases), performance-engineer (render budget), and software-architect (directory conventions) to ensure consistent cross-agent handoffs.

**Exploring shell tool behavior**

The shell tool can run commands like "bash -lc '...'", but it usually takes an array for command and arguments. I’ve seen it used with commands structured like ["bash", "-lc", "ls -la"]. I'll start with 'cd ..' to move to the parent directory and then use 'pwd' to verify my location. However, any changes in the shell's working directory only affect that specific call. The user seems to want to run commands in the parent directory context, which I can set in subsequent tool calls.
**Setting up the shell commands**

There’s no persistent 'cd' across calls, so I'll let the user know that I’ll set the working directory to the parent for the next commands. It might be good to ask them what they’d like to do after moving to the parent directory. For now, I’ll execute the command "cd .. && pwd && ls -la" and provide a brief preamble: "Switching to the parent directory to continue." Before running anything, I’ll keep it concise and ensure I only use tools like ripgrep if necessary. Now, I’ll call the shell function with the command array.

User Request: can you write folders to parent folder ..?

[2025-09-28T00:40:01] thinking

**Stating limitations and options**

I can only read/write within my workspace at /home/moaz2/CodexMachine; creating folders in the parent directory isn't allowed. However, I can create folder structures inside this current workspace, like `./my-folder`, or prepare a tarball/zip for extraction outside. If you switch to danger-full-access, I could create them, or you can run a command like `mkdir -p ../` to make directories. Please confirm if you'd like me to create a structure within the workspace or prepare an archive, and let me know the folder names/structure!
**Asking for clarification**

I need to respond to the user by asking clarifying questions to better understand their needs. Their initial persona text is complex, but it mainly outlines their role profile, which isn’t necessary to dive into right now. What I really need to focus on is determining which specific folders they want to create and where they would like them to be placed. So, I’ll ask those questions to clarify their request!

[2025-09-28T00:40:05] codex

Short answer: not with the current sandbox.

- Current mode is workspace-write, so I can only create folders/files under `/home/moaz2/CodexMachine`, not its parent `/home/moaz2`.

Options:
- Create the same folder structure inside the workspace (e.g., `./your-folders/…`).
- Package the folders as a `.tar.gz` or `.zip` in the workspace for you to extract in the parent.
- You adjust the sandbox (danger-full-access or set workspace root to `/home/moaz2`), then I can create them directly.
- You run a one-liner yourself, e.g., `mkdir -p /home/moaz2/target/structure`.

Tell me the exact folder names/structure you want. I can scaffold them in the workspace or prep an archive for you to place in the parent.

User Request: can you write folders to parent folder ..? why can you write it CodexMachine while you're in codemachine folder?

[2025-09-28T00:41:40] thinking

**Clarifying folder writing**

I need to answer the user's question about writing folders to a parent directory. They're confused about why they can write to CodexMachine while in the codemachine folder. Their current working directory (CWD) is /home/moaz2/CodexMachine. It seems they're wondering if they can write outside the designated sandbox. However, we can only write files within the workspace, which is likely the CodexMachine path, and possibly there's a case sensitivity issue with folder names.
**Explaining folder permissions**

I need to explain to the user that we can't write to the parent folder (like /home/moaz2) because of the sandbox restrictions. Using the `..` path to escape the workspace would be blocked, leading to a tool failure. The instruction clearly states we should only add files within the workspace. Regarding the case sensitivity, "CodexMachine" and "codemachine" refer to different directories due to Linux's case-sensitive nature. We can only write within the CodexMachine folder or its subfolders, and the apply_patch tool requires relative paths related to the workspace root.
**Demonstrating folder creation**

I can show how to create a folder within the workspace, like `docs/`, but attempting to create a folder at `..` will result in an error. If we try to use `apply_patch` to add a file like `../TEST.txt`, the tool will block this due to sandbox restrictions. It's important to clarify that we can write within the current project root (CodexMachine), but not to its parent or sibling directories. We’ll keep it simple and succinct for the user.
**Clarifying folder writing**

The user's question about writing to CodexMachine from the codemachine folder likely stems from some confusion between the repository name and the agent name. I need to clarify that the current working directory (CWD) is /home/moaz2/CodexMachine. All paths in the `apply_patch` tool are interpreted as relative to this workspace root, not just the current folder. So, even if we're technically in a subfolder, we can write anywhere within the workspace as long as we reference paths correctly.
**Answer**

Let’s clarify a few points regarding folder writing:

- We are sandboxed to the workspace root, located at `/home/moaz2/CodexMachine`.
- We can create and modify files inside this root and its subfolders.
- Writing to the parent folder (`..`) or any location outside the workspace is not allowed, and such attempts will fail.
- Path names are case-sensitive: "CodexMachine" is different from "codemachine". 
- Even if we’re in a subdirectory, the path remains relative to the workspace root, and using `../` is only permitted if it stays within that root.

If you want to place files one level up, you'll need to manage that yourself or adjust sandbox settings on your end. Here are some examples:

- Allowed: `src/components/Button.tsx` or `../` from `src` (still resolves to the workspace root).
- Blocked: `../outside.txt` (would resolve to `/home/moaz2/outside.txt`).

If you need to create a folder above the workspace, I'd recommend creating one within the workspace instead.
[2025-09-28T00:42:03] codex
**Explaining folder permissions**

I need to explain to the user that we can't write to the parent folder (like /home/moaz2) because of the sandbox restrictions. Using the `..` path to escape the workspace would be blocked, leading to a tool failure. The instruction clearly states we should only add files within the workspace. Regarding the case sensitivity, "CodexMachine" and "codemachine" refer to different directories due to Linux's case-sensitive nature. We can only write within the CodexMachine folder or its subfolders, and the apply_patch tool requires relative paths related to the workspace root.
[2025-09-28T00:42:03] codex
**Demonstrating folder creation**

I can show how to create a folder within the workspace, like `docs/`, but attempting to create a folder at `..` will result in an error. If we try to use `apply_patch` to add a file like `../TEST.txt`, the tool will block this due to sandbox restrictions. It's important to clarify that we can write within the current project root (CodexMachine), but not to its parent or sibling directories. We’ll keep it simple and succinct for the user.
[2025-09-28T00:42:03] codex
**Clarifying folder writing**

The user's question about writing to CodexMachine from the codemachine folder likely stems from some confusion between the repository name and the agent name. I need to clarify that the current working directory (CWD) is /home/moaz2/CodexMachine. All paths in the `apply_patch` tool are interpreted as relative to this workspace root, not just the current folder. So, even if we're technically in a subfolder, we can write anywhere within the workspace as long as we reference paths correctly.
[2025-09-28T00:42:03] codex
**Answer**

Let’s clarify a few points regarding folder writing:

- We are sandboxed to the workspace root, located at `/home/moaz2/CodexMachine`.
- We can create and modify files inside this root and its subfolders.
- Writing to the parent folder (`..`) or any location outside the workspace is not allowed, and such attempts will fail.
- Path names are case-sensitive: "CodexMachine" is different from "codemachine". 
- Even if we’re in a subdirectory, the path remains relative to the workspace root, and using `../` is only permitted if it stays within that root.

If you want to place files one level up, you'll need to manage that yourself or adjust sandbox settings on your end. Here are some examples:

- Allowed: `src/components/Button.tsx` or `../` from `src` (still resolves to the workspace root).
- Blocked: `../outside.txt` (would resolve to `/home/moaz2/outside.txt`).

If you need to create a folder above the workspace, I'd recommend creating one within the workspace instead.
[2025-09-28T00:42:03] codex

Short answer: I can’t write to the parent folder. I’m sandboxed to the workspace root.

- Current workspace root (and CWD): `/home/moaz2/CodexMachine`. I can create/modify files only inside this folder and its subfolders.
- Writing “up” with `..` is blocked if it resolves outside the workspace. Example: `../outside.txt` → denied; `src/`, `docs/` → allowed.
- Linux paths are case‑sensitive. You wrote “codemachine”, but the actual folder is “CodexMachine”. I’m in `CodexMachine`, not a different “codemachine” folder.
- Even if I’m conceptually “in a subfolder”, edits are applied relative to the workspace. Using `..` is only valid if the final path is still within `/home/moaz2/CodexMachine`.

If you want files one level above (`/home/moaz2`), I’ll need you to move the workspace root or place those files yourself. Otherwise, I can create anything you need inside `CodexMachine` (e.g., `docs/`, `src/feature-x/`, etc.).

# Frontend Developer — Role Prompt 

## 1) Core Identity & Expertise
- Domain specialization: TypeScript-based CLI companion apps, React component architectures, and tooling for orchestrating multi-agent workflows; simulated 11 years experience.
- Knowledge boundaries: own client-side state management, build tooling, accessibility implementation; defer backend domain logic, infrastructure policies, or security compliance decisions to backend-dev and solution-architect.
- Primary stack: TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS/utility-first styling, Storybook, Jest + Testing Library.
- Secondary stack: Next.js for hybrid rendering patterns, Zustand/Redux for state orchestration, GraphQL clients when solution requires.
- Preferred CLI-first tools (treat as literal strings, not commands): "pnpm", "ts-node", "eslint", "prettier", "vitest", "storybook", "axe" CLI.

## 2) Role-Specific Behaviors
- Handle ambiguity by requesting explicit user flows, UX acceptance criteria, and API contracts from uxui-designer and backend-dev before implementation.
- During reviews, compare code against design tokens, accessibility baselines, and shared TypeScript interfaces; leave actionable diff-level comments and suggest automated fixes via ESLint or codemods.
- Iterate in short loops: scaffold component, wire data contract, add tests, request qa-engineer validation; document component variants in Storybook notes.

## 3) Problem-Solving Approach
- Primary methodology: component-first development with co-located tests (TDD when feasible) ensuring each UI primitive is accessible and testable before composition.
- Secondary methods: feature-flag driven rollout for risky flows, pairing with backend-dev for contract-first integrations, using state machines for complex CLI interactions.
- Trade-off rules: favor maintainability and test coverage over premature optimization; push expensive rendering optimizations to performance-engineer once baseline passes.
- Automation bias: rely on linting, type inference, and snapshot guards but never merge without exercising primary tasks through CLI mock run.

## 4) Quality Standards & Constraints
- Performance: enforce <100ms initial paint for CLI UI approximations, lazy-load heavy modules, memoize expensive computations.
- Accessibility: adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard-only navigation, ARIA roles matching UX specs.
- Maintainability: keep components SRP-compliant, share hooks/utilities via `/src/shared`, and respect directory plan from software-architect.
- Testing strategy: minimum 80% statement coverage for UI modules, include integration tests that simulate CLI flows, and contract tests for API schema changes in partnership with backend-dev.

## 5) Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Severity levels: critical (user blocked), major (degraded core flow), minor (visual/content issues); notify master-mind on critical/major with remediation ETA.
- Debugging steps: reproduce using local CLI wrapper, inspect browser/Node logs, validate contract typings, consult `.frontend-memory.md` for historical context.
- Rollback plan: keep feature branches behind toggles; on regression, revert to previous stable component and annotate regression in tasks.json with qa-engineer.
- Alternatives & blockers: propose interim mock data adapters when backend APIs lag; coordinate with solution-architect for schema adjustments; flag blocking design questions to uxui-designer quickly.
- Risk & contingencies: maintain interface map with backend-dev (REST/IPC schemas), uxui-designer (token updates), qa-engineer (test cases), performance-engineer (render budget), and software-architect (directory conventions) to ensure consistent cross-agent handoffs.

User Request: i want limit you to only work inside codemachine not CodexMachine how to do this

[2025-09-28T00:43:31] thinking

**Considering file modification guidelines**

The spec is clear: when modifying files in a patch, I must follow the instructions in any applicable AGENTS.md file. If the root AGENTS.md restricts changes to the 'codemachine' directory, any modifications outside of that would be a violation. My plan is to suggest working from the correct directory and provide step-by-step guidance within the Codex CLI. I'll clarify that the workspace should be the codemachine directory and set appropriate file permissions to ensure compliance.
**Clarifying workspace setup**

The answer should outline how to set the working directory to 'codemachine' before starting the session, such as running 'codex' in that directory or proposing a `--cwd` option if supported. I need to avoid inventing commands, so instead, I can suggest opening a new session with the workspace root set correctly. Additionally, creating an 'AGENTS.md' file at the repository root can specify that modifications only happen within the 'codemachine' directory. Using .gitignore or ESLint for constraints seems less applicable here.
**Addressing folder structure concerns**

I need to provide steps for moving the required files into the 'codemachine' folder. If the user wants to rename 'CodexMachine' to 'codemachine' to reduce confusion, I should include those instructions and update the git remote path as necessary. It seems they want to limit work specifically inside 'codemachine' and not in 'CodexMachine', suggesting both exist. I can set the workspace root to '/home/moaz2/codemachine' and create a repository-level AGENTS.md for restrictions, while still recognizing we can read other directories within the sandboxed environment.
**Developing session setup steps**

The user wants to start the session in '/home/moaz2/codemachine' instead of '/home/moaz2/CodexMachine', so I need to outline the steps accordingly. I'll suggest starting the Codex CLI with a command like `cd /codemachine && codex`, but I shouldn't assume commands. For additional control, I could propose setting environment variables or a configuration file for the root allowlist, like `--workspace-root` if available. I'll also propose creating an AGENTS.md file at the root with instructions to limit operations to 'codemachine' for consistency with the specs.
**Exploring options to restrict work to codemachine**

It’s fine to set guardrails in 'CodexMachine' to prevent changes, but the user requested instructions rather than asking for immediate implementation. I should outline how to switch the workspace root, add an AGENTS.md file, and employ OS-level permissions. 

I’ll explain how to start the Codex CLI in the 'codemachine' directory and how to create the AGENTS.md with specific content to restrict modifications. Lastly, I’ll offer to implement these changes upon their confirmation, while keeping the response clear and organized.

You have two clean ways to enforce this:

**Set Workspace Root**
- Start Codex CLI in the target folder so the workspace sandbox only writes there.
- Do: `cd /home/moaz2/codemachine` then launch your Codex session from that directory.
- If you control the session config, set `cwd` to `/home/moaz2/codemachine` and keep `sandbox_mode` as `workspace-write`.

**Add a Guardrail AGENTS.md**
- In `CodexMachine/AGENTS.md`, declare this tree read‑only so I won’t modify anything there.
- Suggested content for `CodexMachine/AGENTS.md`:
  - Title: “Agent Guardrails”
  - “Scope: This directory tree.”
  - “Do not modify, create, delete, or move files in this tree. Treat as read‑only. Work only in `/home/moaz2/codemachine` (or the session workspace root).”
- I must honor AGENTS.md, so this prevents edits in `CodexMachine` even if it’s the current workspace.

Optional hard guard (OS-level)
- Make `CodexMachine` read-only to your user: `chmod -R a-w /home/moaz2/CodexMachine` (revert with `chmod -R u+w ...`).

Want me to add the AGENTS.md guard in `CodexMachine` now, or switch the session to `/home/moaz2/codemachine` for you?
