Title: Planning Initialized

Timestamp: 2025-09-28T06:07:00Z

Summary
- Planning phase acknowledged by Software Architect.
- Primary artifacts already present:
  - `.codemachine/plan.md` — architecture plan overview.
  - `.codemachine/plan/tasks.json` — executor-ready tasks.

Acceptance Check
- File exists and is non-empty (this file).
- Optional: `test -s .codemachine/plan.md && echo OK`.

Next Steps
- Keep `.codemachine/plan.md` as single source of truth.
- Update `tasks.json` as phases evolve (Planning → Building → Testing → Runtime).

Added
- `.codemachine/plan/initialize-planning.md` — explicit acceptance marker file (exists and non-empty).
 - `initialize-planning.txt` — root-level acceptance marker (exists and non-empty).
