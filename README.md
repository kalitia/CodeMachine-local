## Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

> **✨ CodeMachine Built Itself**
>
> **90% of this entire codebase was generated by CodeMachine from a single specification file.**
> This isn't a demo—it's proof. CodeMachine orchestrated its own architecture, planning, implementation, and testing.

### What is CodeMachine CLI?

CodeMachine CLI is a breakthrough workflow orchestration framework that transforms ambitious project specifications into complete, production-ready codebases. Powered by coordinated AI agents and intelligent workflow engines, CodeMachine tackles the complexity of building entire applications from scratch—handling everything from system architecture to implementation, testing, and deployment automation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get CodeMachine up and running in minutes:

### Prerequisites

CodeMachine requires **Codex** to be installed globally on your system:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

### 1. Install CodeMachine

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/moazbuilds/codemachine.git
cd codemachine

# Install dependencies, build, and link globally
npm install && npm run build && npm link
```

### 2. Create Your Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd ~/your-project-directory

# Run CodeMachine
codemachine
```

### 3. Write Your Specification

On first run, CodeMachine creates a `.codemachine/` folder. Write your project requirements in `.codemachine/inputs/specifications.md`:

```markdown
# My Awesome Project

Build a REST API with user authentication, CRUD operations for posts,
and PostgreSQL database integration. Include proper error handling,
input validation, and comprehensive test coverage.
```

### 4. Choose Your Workflow

Select a workflow template that matches your project:
- **CodeMachine**: Full development lifecycle (architecture → implementation → testing)
- **Smart Build**: Rapid prototyping and iteration

> **More awesome templates coming soon!** We're building workflow templates that solve almost every development problem. Stay tuned!

### 5. Watch the Magic Happen ✨

Sit back as CodeMachine orchestrates specialized agents to:
- Design your system architecture
- Generate implementation plans
- Write production-ready code
- Create automation scripts
- Validate outputs against your specs

### Authentication

Login inside the CodeMachine session:

```bash
# Inside CodeMachine session
/login

# Logout when done
/logout
```

Or use the command:

```bash
codemachine login
```

> **Coming Soon:** Support for **Gemini CLI** and **Claude CLI** is in the works! Multi-provider support will give you flexibility to choose your preferred AI backend.

**That's it!** Your complete codebase will be generated and ready to ship.

**Build Complete Codebases, Not Just Code Snippets**

Traditional code generation creates isolated components. CodeMachine builds entire applications—from full-stack apps and CLI tools to microservices and frameworks. Define your vision in natural language, and specialized agents collaborate to architect, implement, and validate complete production-ready systems.

**The Power of Workflow-Driven Development**

CodeMachine orchestrates sophisticated multi-step workflows that coordinate agents through the entire development lifecycle:

```javascript
// Create workflows that build complete projects
export default {
  name: 'Full-Stack App Builder',
  steps: [
    resolveStep('arch-agent'),                // Design system architecture
    resolveStep('plan-agent'),                // Generate development plan
    resolveStep('task-breakdown'),            // Structure implementation tasks
    resolveStep('code-generation'),           // Implement features iteratively
    resolveStep('runtime-prep'),              // Setup automation scripts
    resolveStep('task-sanity-check'),         // Validate against requirements
    resolveModule('check-task', {             // Loop until completion
      loopTrigger: 'TASKS_COMPLETED=FALSE',
      loopSteps: 3,
      loopMaxIterations: 20
    }),
  ],
};
```

Each workflow step executes specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex architectural challenges, implement intricate features, and ensure quality throughout the process.

**Why CodeMachine?**

- **🏗️ Handles Real Complexity**: Build multi-file, multi-layer applications with proper separation of concerns and design patterns
- **🎯 Specification-Driven**: Write what you want in `.codemachine/inputs/specifications.md`, get a complete codebase
- **🔄 Iterative & Intelligent**: Agents loop through tasks, validate outputs, and refine until requirements are met
- **📐 Architecture-First**: System design and planning happen before a single line of code is written
- **🛡️ Quality Built-In**: Testing, linting, and validation gates ensure production-ready output
- **⚙️ Fully Customizable**: Create workflows for any project type, technology stack, or development methodology

Stop building projects file-by-file. Start orchestrating intelligent agents to construct complete, sophisticated codebases that are ready to ship.
