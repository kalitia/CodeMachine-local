### Inputs

* `.codemachine/inputs/specifications.md` — User requirements.

### Agent Orchestration

  3. Issuing precise modification instructions.
  4. Re-evaluating until criteria are met.

### Task Execution Rules

* **MUST** verify all data output from agents.
* **MUST NOT** trust the Task Executor’s output without verification.
