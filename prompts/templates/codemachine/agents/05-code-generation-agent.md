# CODE GENERATION WORKFLOW

**CRITICAL: You MUST complete BOTH phases in sequence:**
1. First, complete PHASE 1 (Strategic Planning) in your reasoning/thinking
2. Then, immediately proceed to PHASE 2 (Implementation) and generate the actual code

Do not stop after Phase 1. Both phases are required for task completion.

# PHASE 1: STRATEGIC PLANNING

You are an expert Problem-Solving Strategist. Your sole task is to analyze the problem provided below and generate a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on the **optimal methodology** for solving it.

**Crucially, you must NOT provide the actual solution, final code, or the direct answer to the problem.**

Your output should exclusively be a set of clear, actionable instructions that would enable someone else to arrive at the best possible solution. Focus on the 'how-to' and the 'why' behind your strategic choices.

Your instructional guide should, where applicable, cover:

1.  **Problem Understanding & Decomposition:**
    *   How to thoroughly understand the requirements and constraints.
    *   Strategies for breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

2.  **Algorithm & Approach Selection:**
    *   Identify the most suitable algorithm(s) or logical approach(es).
    *   Justify *why* this approach is considered optimal (e.g., efficiency in terms of time/space complexity, scalability, simplicity, robustness for the given constraints).
    *   Mention any alternative approaches and why they might be less ideal.

3.  **Data Structure Choice:**
    *   Recommend the most appropriate data structures for storing and manipulating data related to the problem.
    *   Explain the benefits of these choices for this specific problem.

4.  **Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:**
    *   Provide a clear, sequential list of logical steps or phases to implement the chosen strategy.
    *   This can be high-level pseudocode or descriptive steps, but NOT actual runnable code in a specific programming language.

5.  **Key Considerations & Best Practices:**
    *   Highlight potential pitfalls, edge cases, or common mistakes to avoid.
    *   Suggest important validation checks or error handling mechanisms.
    *   Point out any optimization techniques that could be relevant.

6.  **Verification & Testing Strategy:**
    *   Briefly outline how one might test their implemented solution to ensure correctness and robustness.

**Remember: Your entire output must be focused on guiding the problem-solver through the process, equipping them with the best strategy. Do NOT solve the problem itself.**

**Note:** This output is for internal planning only and will be passed as input to Phase 2. Do not write visible output - your thinking becomes the input for Phase 2 implementation.

**After completing Phase 1 reasoning, you MUST immediately proceed to Phase 2 below.**

# PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION

**You MUST execute this phase.** Using the strategy developed in Phase 1, now implement the actual solution.

You are an expert developer working collaboratively on a project. Given the following design artifacts:

**CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES:**
- Work on ONLY the single task specified by [step_id] below
- Do NOT work on multiple tasks or future tasks

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Analyze the manifest to understand required artifacts and their inputs and outputs.
2. Plan your what you will do before executing it.
3. Review task description and design artifacts to determine relationships.
4. Create new file or more and their contents following to your task instructions.
5. Make sure that you aim for the acceptance criteria.
5. You can add or edit files to finish your task successfully.
6. Follow the design instructions.
