# Runtime Phase 3 â€” Validation Report (Orchestration, Streaming, Delivery)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Master Mind reads plan; agents executed via wrapper; composite prompts assembled; outputs stream; memory files updated; QA validates; Retry/End agents trigger; project-summary generated; graceful exit; no steps skipped.

**Checklist**
- Select and dispatch tasks
  - Expected: Wrapper call logs show Run ID and agent name.
- Composite prompts & exec flags
  - Expected: Prompt assembly logged; exec flags respected.
- Streaming & UI updates
  - Expected: Live progress/tokens streaming visible.
- Instance tracking & states
  - Expected: IDs like `<agent>-<timestamp>`; state transitions recorded.
- Memory writes
  - Check: `ls -1 .codemachine/memory/*.md` lists files; entries updated per run.
- Acceptance & QA
  - Expected: Acceptance criteria evaluated; tests pass; tasks updated in plan.
- Recovery & completion
  - Expected: Summarizer + retry on failure; End agent finalizes; `project-summary.md` exists.

**Results Summary**
- Select/dispatch tasks: Not Executed (manual)
- Composite prompts & exec flags: Not Executed (manual)
- Streaming & UI updates: Not Executed (manual)
- Instance tracking & states: PARTIAL (artifacts/logs exist in workspace)
- Memory writes: PASS (memory files exist)
- Acceptance & QA: PARTIAL (this report recorded; no automated acceptance)
- Recovery & completion: PARTIAL (project-summary.md exists in workspace)

**Issues & Remediation**
- Full orchestration path not exercised live.
  - Remediation: Run an interactive session to drive a full plan end-to-end.
- Lack of automated PTY coverage for streaming/controls.
  - Remediation: Add PTY integration tests and fixtures for plan-driven runs.
