### **Project Specification Schema**

This template is designed to scale with your project's needs.

*   **For simple or initial-phase projects, completing Part 1 (The Essentials) is sufficient.**
*   **For complex, enterprise-grade, or high-fidelity projects, completing Part 2 (Advanced Specifications) is highly recommended** to ensure clarity, reduce risk, and guide a more robust architectural design.

### **Part 1: The Essentials (Core Requirements for Any Project)**

*This section captures the minimum information required for an AI to understand and build a functional application.*

#### **1.0 Project Overview (Required)**
*   **1.1 Project Name:** *[e.g., "SimpleTodo App"]*
*   **1.2 Project Goal:** A one or two-sentence summary of what the project is meant to achieve.
*   **1.3 Target Audience:** Who is this for? *[e.g., "General users who need a simple task manager."]*

#### **2.0 Core Functionality & User Journeys (Required)**
*Describe the primary features and how users will interact with them. Use RFC keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY).*

*   **2.1 Core Features List:** A high-level, bulleted list of the main capabilities.
    *   *Example: User Authentication, Task Management, Profile Settings.*
*   **2.2 User Journeys:** Step-by-step descriptions of user interactions.
    *   *Format:* `User [action] → app [keyword] [reaction] → [outcome]`
    *   *Example:* User clicks delete → app **MUST** show "are you sure?" popup → YES deletes, NO cancels.
    *   *Example:* User submits form → app **MUST** check all fields for validation → show errors OR save and show success.

#### **3.0 Data Models (Required)**
*Define the structure of the data the application will manage.*

*   **Format:** `Entity: field (keyword, [constraints]), ...`
*   *Example (User):* `email` (REQUIRED, valid email), `password` (REQUIRED, 8+ chars, hashed), `name` (REQUIRED)
*   *Example (Task):* `title` (REQUIRED, 100 chars max), `is_complete` (REQUIRED, boolean, default=false), `due_date` (OPTIONAL)

#### **4.0 Essential Error Handling (Required)**
*Describe how the application must behave during common failure scenarios.*

*   **No Internet:** The app **MUST** show an "Offline" message.
*   **Invalid User Input:** The app **MUST** highlight the incorrect field in red with a helpful message.
*   **Server Error:** The app **SHOULD** show a generic "Something went wrong" message with an option to retry.

### **Part 2: Advanced Specifications (For Complex or High-Fidelity Projects)**

*This section adds the formality, detail, and foresight needed for larger, more critical applications.*

#### **5.0 Formal Project Controls & Scope (Highly Recommended)**
*   **5.1 Document Control:**
    *   **Version:** *[e.g., 1.0]* | **Status:** *[e.g., Approved]* | **Date:** *[e.g., October 27, 2025]*
*   **5.2 Detailed Scope:**
    *   **In Scope:** An explicit bulleted list of functionalities that **WILL** be delivered.
    *   **Out of Scope:** An explicit bulleted list of functionalities that **WILL NOT** be delivered to prevent scope creep.
*   **5.3 Glossary of Terms & Acronyms:** A table defining all domain-specific terminology (e.g., ESG, CBAM, GHG).

#### **6.0 Granular & Traceable Requirements (Recommended for Traceability)**
*This formalizes the User Journeys from Part 1 into a trackable format.*

| ID | Requirement Name / User Story | Description | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FR-001**| User Login | The system **MUST** allow a registered user to log in with an email and password. | Critical |
| **FR-002**| AI Document Verification | The system **MUST** use an LLM to extract data from uploaded invoices. | High |

#### **7.0 Measurable Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) (Critical for Architecture)**
*Define the quality attributes and constraints. Each NFR should be specific and measurable.*

| ID | Category | Requirement | Metric / Acceptance Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NFR-PERF-001**| Performance| API Response Time | 95% of read-only API calls **MUST** complete in < 250ms. |
| **NFR-ACC-001** | **Accuracy** | AI Data Extraction| Key fields from structured invoices **MUST** be extracted with >90% accuracy. |
| **NFR-REL-001** | **Reliability**| System Uptime | The service **MUST** maintain 99.5% uptime. |
| **NFR-SEC-001** | Security | Data Privacy | **MUST** comply with GDPR and KSA PDPL data handling standards. |
| **NFR-SCALE-001**| Scalability| Concurrent Users | **MUST** support 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation. |
| **NFR-EXT-001** | **Extensibility**| Future Regulations | The architecture **MUST** allow adding a new reporting framework via configuration, not a code rewrite. |


#### **8.0 Technical & Architectural Constraints (Optional)**
*Provide specific technical directives if you have them. If not, the AI will propose a suitable architecture.*

*   **8.1 Technology Stack:** *[e.g., Frontend: React, Backend: Node.js, Database: PostgreSQL]*
*   **8.2 Architectural Principles:** *[e.g., "The system **MUST** be a microservices architecture."]*
*   **8.3 Deployment Environment:** *[e.g., "The application **MUST** be containerized using Docker and deployed to AWS."]*

#### **9.0 Assumptions, Dependencies & Risks (Highly Recommended for Risk Management)**
*   **9.1 Assumptions:** List statements considered true without proof.
    *   *Example: "Third-party emission factor databases will be accessible via a stable API."*
*   **9.2 Dependencies:** List external factors the project relies on.
    *   *Example: "Project delivery depends on the finalization of EU CBAM implementation rules."*
