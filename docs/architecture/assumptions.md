# Assumptions

- 2025-09-27T07:03:33+03:00 Assuming local developer workstations provide Node.js >=20.10.0 to support the TypeScript (Node.js) CLI defined in the Technology Stack (source: ../../runner-prompts/user-input.md, "ðŸš€ Core Features > Technology Stack").
- 2025-09-27T07:03:39+03:00 Operating the CLI primarily through local execution without relying on external SaaS services, aligning with the solution statement that the agent "runs locally" (source: ../../runner-prompts/user-input.md, "ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview > Solution").
- 2025-09-27T07:03:43+03:00 Relying on the presence of Git tooling and a bash-compatible shell so the documented Codex wrapper commands with `--skip-git-repo-check` can execute as shown (source: ../../runner-prompts/user-input.md, "ðŸ”§ Configuration & Architecture > CLI Orchestration Layer").
